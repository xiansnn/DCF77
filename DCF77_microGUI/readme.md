# DCF77 project

## Electronic circuitry support
The initial DCF77 projet was derived from Morse decoder project. This is why the signalimput input is audio instead of a classical Radio receiver.
The conversion from audio signal to DCF time frame is done by the electronic circuit below:

A full description can be found [here](https://github.com/xiansnn/hardware-projects/tree/main/audio%20envelope%20electronic%20circuitry)

The resulting interface loks like the following capture:
